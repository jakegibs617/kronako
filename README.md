-Lightbox shortcodes:
<!--
The shortcode uses named arguments because I wanted some of them (such as width and center) to be optional. The arguments are:

name: Required argument which is the name of the image resource to load. Note: To tell Hugo to search for any file that includes the name and return the first hit, use wildcards, as in the example below.

title: The title of the image. Used by the alt tag and by Lightbox.

width: An optional width to override the elementâ€™s width.

class: An optional argument to add a custom class to the figure.

centered: An optional argument which, if it exists and has any value, will wrap the image and link in a div with a center class. -->
